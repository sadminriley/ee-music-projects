# Simple two button drum + knob synth

For this project, I used the Daisy Seed hardware. [Daisy seeds](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) are a very powerful and robust way
to get yourself started in EE, code, and making music. I believe I will prototype a whole eurorack module with seeds.....eventually.

# Simple two button drum + knob synth

For this project, I used the Daisy Seed hardware. [Daisy seeds](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) are a very powerful and robust way to get yourself started in EE, code, and making music.

I believe I will prototype a whole eurorack module with seeds...eventually. This is a new found project/love of mine, so everything may not be exactly perfect. I certainly try my best.


The two buttons control the kickdrum and the snare. The potentiometer controls the oscillator.



This was inspired by one of their many example repos that can be found [here.](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples/tree/master/seed/Drum)

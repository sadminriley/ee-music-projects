# Simple two button drum + knob synth

For this project, I used the Daisy Seed hardware. [Daisy seeds](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) are a very powerful and robust way
to get yourself started in EE, code, and making music. I believe I will prototype a whole eurorack module with seeds.....eventually.

This was inspired by one of their many example repos that can be found [here.](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples/tree/master/seed/Drum)
